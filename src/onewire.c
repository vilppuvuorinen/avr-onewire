 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 * <p>This is an universal 1-Wire master library for AVR MCUs based on unfinished ds1820 library by Ilari Nummila, Olli-Pekka Korpela and Jukka Pitk√§nen.</p>
 * <p>The rom search function supports up to 31 conflicts which results in guaranteed support for 32 devices. The theoretical maximum amount of devices is 2^32 but the actual amount is up to luck. This will not cause any problems due to signal integrity restrictions. OW_MAX_ROMS defines the maximum amount of devices. Memory is always reserved for the maximum amount of devices.</p>
 * @section Connections
 * <p>1-Wire bus can be connected with external pull-up resistor to Vcc or using internal pull-up. Internal pull-ups cannot power devices operating on parasitic power or drive a bus with multiple externally powered devices. Internal pull-ups are selected by defining constant OW_INTERNAL_PULLUP. I/O pin is selected with OW_PORT, OW_PIN, OW_DIRECTION and OW_BIT.</p>
 * @section Usage
 * <p>OW_MAX_ROMS and F_CPU in header file have to be set up according to application. OwInit() is called to initialize the bus. If multiple devices are connected OwSearchRom() function is called to search device roms. This allows addressing devices with rom index.</p>
 * <p>From this point writing commands to devices with OwWriteByteTo() and reading responses with OwReadByte() is fairly straight forward procedure.</p>
 * @section int_comp Interrupt compatibility
 * <p>1-Wire read and write operations are time-sensitive and prone to failure if interrupts are being handled simultaneously with either type of operation. By default Interrupt Service Routines written in C tend to free a couple of registers and store SREG before even executing any user-written code. This sums up to 16 cycles (2 us with 8 MHz clock) of PUSH, POP, IN, OUT and CLR calls without the user-written interrupt handling. The shortest delay used in this library is 5 us long. This basically rules out all interrupts.</p>
 * <p> Interrupt handling during reset, read and write can be prevented by defining constant OW_BLOCK_INTERRUPTS which disables interrupts for the duration of the operation. OW_BLOCK_INTERRUPTS_BITLEVEL allows interrupts between separate bits and outside the wait time for presence pulse after reset pulse.</p>
